This folder contains the code to reproduce the results of the article: 
"Modeling Alzheimerâ€™s Disease: Bayesian Copula Graphical Model from Demographic, Cognitive, and Neuroimaging Data"
by Lucas Vogels, Reza Mohammadi, Marit Schoonhoven, Ilker Birbil and Martin Dyrba

It contains four files:
1. Load_and_clean_data.R. This file loads the raw data from an excel file, cleans the data and saves them as a .Rdata file. To obtain the raw excel data, please reach out to the main author
2. Create_main_figures.R. This file load the cleaned data file, runs the algorithm, and creates most figures in the main article and figures S2 and S3 in the supplementary material
3. Create_prob_dens_figures.R. This file load the cleaned data file, runs the algorithm, and creates the probability density plots shown in the supplementary material
4. Create_figures_left_and_right_separate.R. This file loads the raw data from an excel file, cleans the data (this time separating the left and right regions), runs the algorithm, and creates figure S4 in the supplementary material

In case of any questions, please reach out to Lucas Vogels, l.f.o.vogels@uva.nl
